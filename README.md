# decision-making-loops-program-cpp
In C++, decision-making statements allow a program to make choices based on conditions. They're like the brain of your program — guiding it on what to do next depending on the input or situation.

### Common types:
. if, if-else, if-else-if

. switch-case

. Nested if

. Logical operators (&&, ||, !)



### 1.Quadrant Finder
Have you ever plotted a point on a graph and wondered which slice of the plane it falls into? This simple C++ program takes you back to the classic Cartesian coordinate system.
Enter any (x, y) value and it instantly tells you whether the point lies in the First, Second, Third, or Fourth quadrant — or if it’s just chilling on the axes or at the origin.

This program uses multiple if-else conditions combined with logical operators like && to make precise decisions based on the signs of x and y.

### 2.Grade Calculator
This program reads a student's marks and calculates the corresponding grade. The grading is based on common academic ranges, such as:

90 and above: Grade A

80–89: Grade B

70–79: Grade C

60–69: Grade D

Below 60: Grade F

The program uses an if-else-if ladder to compare the input marks and determine the correct grade.

This is a good example of how conditional logic is used in real-life applications such as academic result systems.

### 3.Even or Odd Checker
This C++ program checks whether a given integer is even or odd. It uses the modulus (%) operator to determine if the number is divisible by 2.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. This program is a basic example of using arithmetic operations and conditional statements in C++.

It helps in understanding how to work with conditions and numerical checks.

### 4.Vowel or Consonant Checker
This program reads a single alphabet character from the user and checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

It compares the input character against the set of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) using multiple if-else conditions. It also handles both uppercase and lowercase letters by converting the input to lowercase before comparison.

This program is useful for understanding character input, condition checking, and logical operators in C++.

### 5. Largest Number (Using Nested if)
This C++ program finds the largest number among three integers entered by the user. It uses nested if statements to compare the values step by step.

First, it compares the first two numbers. Then, based on that result, it compares the greater one with the third number. This allows the program to find the maximum value using logical steps.

This program helps in learning how to use if conditions inside other if blocks (nested conditions) and how to structure multi-step decision-making in C++.

### 6. Positive, Negative, or Zero Checker
This program takes an integer input and checks whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. It uses a series of if-else statements to compare the input number with zero.

If the number is greater than zero, it is positive.

If it is less than zero, it is negative.

If it is equal to zero, the program states that it is zero.

This is one of the most basic examples of conditional checking and is useful for beginners to understand how decisions are made in programs.
